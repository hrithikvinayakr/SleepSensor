# SleepSensor
An application which MONITOR the person's EYES and ALARMS if both eyes are CLOSED for more than 10 SECONDS ( Considers the person is asleep). I built this after i fell asleep while STUDYING but this is very helpful in cases of DRIVING and such other tasks which requires concentration.
